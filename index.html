      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
      <p>
        I'm 17 years old, I live in Ottawa, Canada, and I'm in grade 12 at AY Jackson McAfee Secondary School.
        I'm so passionate for music and drumming that I listen to music almost everyday.
        I started to take drum lessons in 2012 (I think), though I still have quite a bit to improve on.
        I started producing music using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) in the summer of 2019; the music wasn't very sophisticated, but it was still very catchy.
        Ever since I started to produce music, I have been slowly improving and learning the ways in which hit songs are thought of and designed.
        The second semester of grade 11 was when I was introduced to computer science, and I immediately knew it was something I was good at, and I enjoyed almost as much as music.
        I especially love trying to figure out the math that is involved with programming certain drawings and animations.
        After high school is all done, I plan to go into something to do with music producing and or into physics.
        Physics is easily my first choice for a career path because I love learning about how our universe works and all the things that we still don't have answers for.
        My second choice for a career path is music performance or music production, and my third or backup choice is computer science.

        <H3>1. Intro to JS: Drawing & Animation</h3>
        <img width="20%" src="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/img_js.png">
        <p>
          Intro to JS was my very first introduction to javascript, though there were only a few new concepts in it that I didn't
          already know about because I had already learned C++ the year before. There were a few minor differences in the syntax
          of the different functions. This module is of the basics of javascript, hence the name, so I will be using these
          concepts in almost all of my future programs. The animation aspect of the module impacted me the most because it had
          the greatest difference from what I had learned prior to completing this module.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>2. Intro to HTML/CSS: Making Webpages</h3>
        <img width="40%" src="https://aplusweb.design/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/html5-and-css3.png">
        <p>
          Before compleating this module, I had no idea of how websites were coded and what language they are usually coded with.
          Now that I've completed it, I'm quite surprised of how simple and easy it is to create a webpage. CSS gives you a very
          readable layout to formatting text in a webpage, and HTML gives you such a simple way to put text onto a webpage. I'm
          going to be creating many stunning webpages in the future, now that I know how easy the basics are.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>3. Advanced JS: Natural Simulations</h3>
        <img width="40%" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/images/khan-logo-dark-background.new.png">
        <p>
          I espiecially love challenging myself, and this module did just that at the time. The procedure of figuring out how to
          simulate certain things that we might see around us, will be very useful to me in the future when I program more
          complicated things. Being taught how to code vectors, forces, and angular movement significantly widened what my future
          ideas will be.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>4. Algorithms</h3>
        <img width="25%" src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/ka-perseus-images/dfd834ca82cc24414aec63f2c86dc9690b19d840.jpg">
        <p>
          Coming up with algorithms for different things is an essential skill for becoming a master programmer. It's not only
          challenging, it's also quite fun for me to figure out the right algorithms, but to be able to do that, you have to
          understand algorithms, where they come from, and why some of them are a thing. Sorting arrays is something that seems
          so simple to us, because we can just use our already knowledgable brains to rearange arrays, but for a computer it
          needs specific instructions to follow. Though those instructions can be done in many different ways that produce the
          same result, and that amazes me a little.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>5. Computers</h3>
        <img width="40%" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/CYyrlX8DKOP2ErABkKWKFPegkdGG2hCMCyJcHc8TKRgqMhZgluBeuDP12gcaCJLvckuawXbjCRf4JGV6kJW1pIQc4S-VKvS-ewgX">
        <p>
          I had no idea that that was how computers functioned in that much detail. I knew they used logic gates and bits, but
          not that well. After completing this module, I'm feeling like I need to learn more about how computers work, and
          maybe I can use this kowledge to go on and make an amazing breakthrough in quantum computing. Without the knowledge of
          how normal computers work, no one would be able t do much with quantum computing.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>6. The Internet</h3>
        <img width="40%" src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1445478.jpg">
        <p>
          After I had completed this module, I was thinking to myself just how interesting the internet really is. Not to forget
          about how easy it is to hack and trick people using the internet as well. Now that I know so much more about
          cybercrime, I will try to be a lot more secure myself, by using a VPN, and not sharing as much personal data on the
          internet.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>7. Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations</h3>
        <img width="40%" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4NSrSWDov6eMdq76sm3k45igxlBHywnOljo840bDPuVK7V50x_Rvmk-V8URr9CI4Jw">
        <p>
          Many things I learned in this module, I have already used a few times in other programs, such as buttons,
          transformations, and scenes. In the future, I'm going to be programming many more games, because this module showed
          me how much fun it is to program games compared to other types of programs. Plus, as a bonus, you get to play and test
          your games as you program them and when you're done programming them.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>8. HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive</h3>
        <img width="25%" src="https://d3njjcbhbojbot.cloudfront.net/api/utilities/v1/imageproxy/https://coursera-course-photos.s3.amazonaws.com/83/e258e0532611e5a5072321239ff4d4/jhep-coursera-course4.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=1">
        <p>
          This module has now opened my doors to a way of editing the aspects of HTML element with JS, using the Document Object
          Model. I understood everything that was being taught to me in this module, and I could see how many different uses this
          had. Since I completed this module, I have started to use other libraries that are also used for manipulating the
          aspects of HTML elements, such as w3.CSS (which I used to make this website).<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>9. HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive With JQuery</h3>
        <img width="40%" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Logo_jQuery.svg/512px-Logo_jQuery.svg.png">
        <p>
          This was one of the modules that I struggled with completing, because I didn't quite understand why you would use jQuery
          when you could just use the standard DOM library. Though, it did expand my horizons on what I knew was out on the
          internet that could be used to do the same sort of things. It just came down to preference and what feature the
          programmer was trying to code, that determines which libraries are used.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h3>10. Microbit: Motion Sensor/Compass</h3>
        <img width="30%" src="https://www.microbit.org/images/microbit-front.png">
        <p>
          This not a module on Khan Academy, but a proect that I had to do in the course that I'm taking right now, SCI4U. It has
          to do with a piece of electronics, called the Microbit. The Microbit has many different features, but my group of three
          had to focus on the motion sensor and the compass of the microbit. We had to show off that specifi feature to the class
          by coding it to output an arrow pointing in the specific direction that is was facing on to the LCD screen. This
          project showed me that it was not only possible to code software and webpages, but also hardware and robots, which was
          so much more rewarding. I will definitely be doing more with robots and such in the future, as I continue to think
          about what the world would be like with AI.

      <h3>5. What does it mean to have good programming practices?</h3>
      <p>
        Good programming practices are essential to being a good collaborator and team person, they help the workflow of the team
        run smoothly and with harmony. The main programming practice that most of the smaller ones fall under, would be to write
        readable code, even someone who isn’t that experienced in computer science should be able to read and understand your
        code. Some more specific practices related to readable code are: documenting your code so it’s easier for someone to
        understand what specific lines are doing, being consistent with indentation and naming schemes, grouping code, etc.
        Having good programming practices can also help a lot with getting a computer programming job, and help you keep it, by
        letting yourself appear as a very good team player.<br><br>
        Having good programming practices also involves the planning stages in designing a software or website. Writing
        pseudocode, and even before that, having a concrete idea of what you want the final result to be. Pseudocode should allow
        you to follow a plan and to complete the basis of the software or website before getting lost in the extra and not so
        necessary details and functions. Good programming practices not just helps the people working with you, but also improves
        your own workflow significantly.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>6. Summarize your experience with khan academy.</h3>
      <p>
        My experience with Khan academy was pretty fun and educational most of the time. I learnt a lot about programming,
        computer science, and even how the internet worked from the smallest parts of computer to how all the computers across
        the earth can communicate with each other. I learned things about how the internet worked that I had no idea that that
        was how it all came together in the end. Though there were some challenges and projects that I didn’t enjoy or weren’t
        recognizing that the code was working but it wasn’t the exact code that the challenge wanted you to type. Even though
        this course is over, I am most definitely going to be continuing to watch the lessons, complete the challenges, and
        accomplish the projects.<br><br>
      </p>
      <h3>10. How can art help guide you through learning about programming and computer science?</h3>
      <p>
        Without art and creativity, what would the web be? A place with only plain and boring websites with facts and news, but
        nothing with games or interesting visuals. Art is one of the most important things when it comes to thinking up ideas for
        almost all types of programs. When you have an idea for a software or a website that you want to become a reality, you
        may need to research things that you haven’t learnt yet. It could be a specific piece of code or a whole area of
        computer science that you didn’t even know about before. Having these ideas and being creative, forces you to learn new
        things and expand your horizons of what you are capable of, that in the long term, can really benefit your career and
        happiness.
